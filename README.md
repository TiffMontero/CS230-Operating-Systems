The Gaming Room was a client looking to expand their web-based game "Draw It or Lose It" onto another platform in hopes to reach a wider audience. I felt pretty strongly on my input weighing out the pros and cons to each platform along with my final recommendation. If I had a chance to revice a particular section, it would be my evaluation of the UML diagram. I was not thorough enough with my initial evaluation and could have gone into much more detail to really highlight the specifications of what my client wanted. I prioritize the client's needs with this being the second platform they expanded to and recommended a lower cost platfor with a wider reach before moving into a platform that isn't as popular. Also, recommending cloud storage makes it much easier for the client to upgrade as their need for more storage arises. This will make their growth much easier, especially in the beginning when it can feel more fickle.
When designing software, I usually prefer to start with bare bones and slowly build on that. Especially after learning about Agile, it really helped solidify that small iterations can speed up designing the software in the long term. Focusing on one feature at a time and intermingling them together as you complete them can help you find any bugs and their root cause.
